# Available support channels

If you need help or assistance, the easiest option is to open an issue or
discussion on Covenant's Github page. We will respond according to the stated
response times in the `GOVERNANCE.md` document.

For MLabs' staff, there is an internal `#covenant` Slack channel, which we use
to discuss any work to be done on Covenant.
