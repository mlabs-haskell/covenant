Our policy is to support the latest three GHC versions; see the Cabal file's
`tested-with` field to see which exact versions are supported. This is enforced
using `get-tested` in our CI.

We support only [Tier 1 platforms](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/platforms#tier-1-platforms). 
Covenant is developed using the lowest supported version.
