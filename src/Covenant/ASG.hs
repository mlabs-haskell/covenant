-- Contains the basic functionality to build up Covenant expressions
-- programmatically.
--
-- Throughout, we will refer to the \'ASG\' in a number of contexts. This stands
-- for \'abstract syntax graph\', which is an AST (abstract syntax tree) with as
-- much sharing of substructure as possible. This makes it a DAG (directed
-- acyclic graph), hence its name change. We achieve this using hash consing:
-- please see the Covenant wiki for more details about how this works.
