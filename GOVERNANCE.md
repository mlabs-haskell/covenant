# Project Governance

## Project Overview

Covenant is developed and maintained by [MLabs](https://www.mlabs.city/).

## Team structure

### Co-maintainers

**Koz Ross** (@kozross)
- **Role**: Technical lead
- **Email**: <koz@mlabs.city>

**Sean Hunter** (@gnumonik)
- **Role**: Developer
- **Email**: <sean@mlabs.city>

### Shared responsibilities

- Code review and approval
- Issue triage and management
- Release planning and execution

## Decision-making process

### Consensus required

Both maintainers must agree on:

- Major architectural changes
- Breaking API changes
- New feature additions
- Release timing
- Contributor guidelines changes

### Individual authority

Each maintainer can independently:
- Merge small bug fixes and improvements
- Respond to issues and community questions
- Create and assign issues
- Update documentation

### Conflict resolution

When we disagree:

1. **Discussion**: Extended discussion to understand perspectives
2. **Research**: Gather community input if needed
3. **Compromise**: Find middle ground or alternative solution
4. **Escalation**: If needed, seek input from trusted community members
5. **Temporary Decision**: If urgent, implement temporary solution with plan to revisit

## Communication

### Internal team communication

- **Ad-hoc**: #covenant channel at MLabs' Slack

### Community communication

- **Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **Discussions**: General project discussion
- **Pull requests**: Code contributions
- **Email**: <info@mlabs.city> for private matters

## Contribution guidelines

### Community contributions

The review, and approval, of either maintainer is required.

## Response times

We aim to respond to:

- Security issues: Within 24 hours (one of us)
- Urgent bugs: Within 24-48 hours
- General issues: Within 3-5 days
- Pull requests: Within 1 week
- Community discussions: Within 1 week

# Release process

1. **Planning**: Decide features and timeline together
2. **Development**: Divide work based on expertise
3. **Review**: Cross-review all significant changes
4. **Testing**: Shared responsibility for testing
5. **Release**: Both approve final release

## Code of conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Both
maintainers are responsible for enforcement.
